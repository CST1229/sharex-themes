Dump for image effects I make using [ShareX](https://getsharex.com).

---

List of effects:
* ScratchProject.sxie: The first effect I made. Adds a border to your images that imitates a [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) project.
* ScratchProjectBad.sxie: The "poor man's version" of ScratchProject.sxie, created as a joke. Just stretches an image of the project border across your image.
* WHAT.sxie: Makes your images into a funny WHAT meme.
